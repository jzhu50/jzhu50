# Copilot CHAT?
# 3/12/2025
# Time spent: 1.5

DISCO:
- For some reason Copilot had a difficult time retrieving the readme file even after I provided the path and the permanent link to p00 repo, so I manually pasted the content in readme to the chat
- 

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
- Around 5 tries for me.
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
- I haven't caught any errors yet.
q2: Wouldn't it be cool if Copilot can directly make edits to the files on GitHub?
- YES!
