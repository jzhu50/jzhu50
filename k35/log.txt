# Copilot CHAT?
# 3/12/2025
# Time spent: 3

DISCO:
- When my partner and I first told it to write __init__.py, it imported a python library "Flask-SQLAlchemy"
- For some reason Copilot had a difficult time retrieving the readme file even after I provided the path and the permanent link to p00 repo, so I manually pasted the content in readme to the chat
- On the register page it creates, it asks the user for their email, username, and password. However, on the login page it creates, it only asks for username and password
- When I told it to include authentication in __init__.py, it imported the library "werkzeug.security" and used hash for password
- It's really bad for styling...Either the style doesn't match what I envision or the changes are not reflected on the app at all (connection/linking issues?)
- Don't know if it's just me but every time you ask it to modify a file you have to re-select all the repo/folders/files it needs access for, which is really annoying if you're testing out different things on the same file.
- Overall, the time it takes to respond to requests is really long.

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
- Around 7 tries for me.
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
- I haven't caught any errors yet.
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
- Honestly, the outputs are very similar in both their structures and content.
q3: Wouldn't it be cool if Copilot can directly make edits to the files on GitHub?
q4: Is password security guaranteed by the use of hashed passwords? Do we need to use hash if we want to publish our websites online?
